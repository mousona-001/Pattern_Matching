# Pattern_Matching
Some conceptual problems on Pattern Matching in C#

1. Check Type 

a. Write a method that takes an object as input and prints:
"Integer" if it's an int
"Double" if it's a double
"String" if it's a string
"Unknown Type" otherwise

b. Even or Odd using Pattern Matching

Write a method that takes an object and:
If it's an int, print whether it's even or odd
Otherwise, print "Not an integer"


2. Pattern Matching with switch Expression

a. Shape Area Calculation

Create a base class Shape and derived classes:
Circle (with Radius)
Rectangle (with Width and Height)
Triangle (with Base and Height)
Write a method CalculateArea(Shape shape) that uses pattern matching inside a switch expression to return the area of the given shape.
